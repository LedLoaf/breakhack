Something in the ways of NETHACK
================================

A simple nethack similar game written in C using SDL2.

Idea
----
Randomly generated maps/rooms. Leveling system, permadeath,
multiple classes. Casual and fun for 10-15 minutes during a break
from regular work/play.

I wanted to practice C and I'm comfortable using SDL2. The assets
are graciously taken from the web. More info in the README in the
assets folder.
